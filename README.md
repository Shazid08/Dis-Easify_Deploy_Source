# 🩺 DIS-EASIFY — AI-Powered Disease Prediction Web App

## 📘 Overview
**DIS-EASIFY** is a full-stack, AI-driven **web application** that predicts multiple human diseases — including **Heart Disease**, **Diabetes**, **Pneumonia**, **Breast Cancer**, and **General Illnesses** — based on user-provided symptoms.  
The platform also recommends **specialized doctors** to help patients get faster and more accurate treatment.

Built using **Django**, **Machine Learning**, and a **clean interactive UI**, DIS-EASIFY bridges the gap between AI and healthcare accessibility for patients and doctors alike.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
| Disease | Model Used |
|----------|-------------|
| Heart Disease | Random Forest / Logistic Regression |
| Diabetes | Support Vector Machine (SVM) |
| Breast Cancer | Decision Tree / Gradient Boosting |
| Pneumonia | CNN using TensorFlow & Keras |
| General Diseases | Ensemble Classifier |

Each model is trained on open medical datasets and fine-tuned for prediction accuracy and performance.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. The user enters symptoms or uploads an image (e.g., X-ray for Pneumonia).  
2. Data is preprocessed and passed to the relevant ML model.  
3. The system predicts the disease and displays results with confidence levels.  
4. The app recommends doctors based on the predicted disease type.  
5. A summary dashboard visualizes all predictions and insights.  

---

The app follows Django’s **Model-View-Template (MVT)** architecture for clear separation of logic, data, and presentation.

## 🧰 Skills Used
- **Machine Learning** — TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-Learn  
- **Web Development** — Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Data Visualization** — Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Data Analysis** — Pandas, NumPy  
- **UI/UX** — Figma for design prototyping  
- **AI Integration** — Model deployment with Flask/Django APIs  

---

## 🩹 Example Use Case
> A user enters symptoms such as “shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue” → the app predicts **Heart Disease (91% confidence)** → recommends a **Cardiologist** → provides a visual health risk analysis using Matplotlib.

## 💡 Future Enhancements
- 🗣️ Voice-based symptom input using Speech-to-Text  
- 📱 Mobile responsive PWA (Progressive Web App)  
- 🧬 Integration with real EHR (Electronic Health Records)  
- 🤖 AI chatbot for health Q&A assistance  
- 🧾 Personalized health reports downloadable as PDFs
